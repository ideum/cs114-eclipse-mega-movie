    <!--Intro Copy-->

    <string name="intro_text">On August 21, 2017, a solar eclipse will be visible in North America. People in the narrow <b>path of totality</b>
        will see the sun\'s disk completely covered by the moon. This app makes it easy
        to capture images of the eclipse. Your images can also become part of an exciting citizen science project.</string>
    <string name="intro_text_1">Everyone! This app does all the hard work of controlling your smartphone
        camera to capture images of the eclipse at just the right times. You can use it with just your phone
    or with an external lens and tripod to get even sharper images of this once-in-a-lifetime event.</string>
    <string name="intro_text_2">The app is very easy to use. You just have to point your phone in the right direction during the eclipse
    and the app takes the pictures for you. If you have an external lens and tripod, the app will help you set everything up
    to get the best shots possible.</string>

        Safety Warning

    <string name="safety_warning">
        Even a short glance at the sun can cause permanent eye damage. That’s also true during the first and last
        phases of an eclipse when the sun’s disk is partially covered. So while the dimmer light of a partial
        eclipse may tempt you, the only time you can safely view the sun is the short period called totality, when
        the sun is completely covered by the moon.

    <!--About Megamovie Mobile Copy-->
    <string name="about_megamovie">About this app
        \n\nThis app allows you to capture images of the solar eclipse on August 21, 2017.
        It also lets you share your photos with scientists for a citizen-science project led by the Space Sciences Laboratory and Google.
        Click <a href="https://eclipsemega.movie/">here</a> to learn more about the Megamovie Project. The Eclipse Megamovie Mobile app
        was created by Ideum and the Space Sciences Laboratory at UC Berkeley.
        \n\nThe app can capture valuable scientific information without additional equipment.
        But you can obtain even better results with an external lens and tripod. If you already have this equipment or want to learn more,
        use our built-in Eclipse Orientation Mode to customize the app.
        \n\nIf you are using an external lens and tripod, the app has a Calibration Mode that will
        help you focus the lens and point the camera in the right direction. You can practice by capturing images of the moon.
        \n\nOne outcome of the Megamovie Project will be a movie of the eclipse as it moves across the US. The movie will incorporate high-quality images
        captured by trained volunteers with DSLR cameras. Once it is available, you can download and view it in the Eclipse Megamovie section.
    </string>

    <!--Orientation Copy-->
    <string name="orientation_intro">
        The Orientation mode helps you determine how best to use the app.
        \n\nAnswer a few questions on the next screen to optimize your eclipse experience.
    </string>

    <string name="equipment_info_phone">
        The Megamovie Mobile app is designed to help you use your camera phone to take the best possible images of the solar eclipse.
        It tells you when and where to see the eclipse, how to aim your camera when the eclipse is about to start, and automatically controls your camera’s settings
        and shutter to take a series of photos during the event. All you’ll have to do is be ready and follow a few simple instructions when the time comes.\n\nThe
        app also gives you a way to practice before the eclipse so you’ll feel comfortable when the big day arrives—by taking pictures of the moon. Go to Moon-test to try it out.
    </string>
    <string name="equipment_info_equipment">
        Holding a camera by hand can cause tiny vibrations that blur photos.
        This can be especially troublesome with astronomical images. Mounting your phone on a tripod is an easy way to improve your photos.
        There are many kinds of tripods available for cell phones, including inexpensive ones made by Joby, Square Jellyfish, and Charger City.
        Also, while your phone may have a great camera, images of the sun are likely to be small unless you use an external lens like those
        made by Apexel, Hsini, and Neewer. We recommend using a lens with a magnification of at least 20x, although the app is
        compatible with any lens. Lenses like these are very portable and can help you take great photos of many things in addition to the eclipse.
        \n\nOnce you’ve decided on the equipment you’ll use, go to My Eclipse to enter your choice (you can change it at any time).
        \n\nIf you’re using an especially high-powered lens, you might consider using a tracking-mount. A relatively compact and inexpensive choice
        is the Star Adventurer made by Sky-Watcher.

    </string>
    <string name="equipment_info_dslr">
        If you want to use a separate camera to photograph the eclipse, you can still use the eclipse map and countdown functions in the Megamovie Mobile app.

        \n\nYou may also be interested in being an official volunteer to capture images for the Megamovie itself. To learn more, visit the <a href="https://eclipsemega.movie/">Megamovie Website</a>.

    <!--Phases Copy-->
    <string name="first_contact_dialog_message">This is when the edge of the moon first
        begins to cover the sun. Even though the sun will start to get dimmer at this point,
        it’s still not safe to look directly at the eclipse.\n</string>
    <string name="second_contact_dialog_message">In a total solar eclipse, this is when
        totality begins and the sun’s disk is completely covered by the moon. It is safe to remove
        your eclipse glasses when you can no longer see the bright
        sun through them. You can now see the sun’s hot, hazy outer atmosphere: the corona! \n</string>
    <string name="mid_eclipse_dialog_message">
        The sun’s corona, a halo of ionized gases, extends millions of miles into space.
        At over 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, it is much hotter than the sun’s surface. You can only see the whole corona during a total eclipse,
        such as this one.
    </string>
    <string name="third_contact_dialog_message">Third contact is the moment when totality
        ends and the sun begins to emerge from the moon’s shadow. As soon as the bright sun appears, you must put your eclipse glasses back on.\n</string>
    <string name="fourth_contact_dialog_message">This is the end of the eclipse.\n</string>


    <!--Moon Test Copy-->
    <string name="moon_test_intro">
        By using the app to capture images of the moon, you\'ll become familiar with how the
        app works and be ready to use it to photograph the main event: the solar eclipse.
        \n\nThis will be especially helpful if you will be using an external lens and tripod during the eclipse.
    </string>
    <string name="moon_test_select_time">
        When would you like to start taking pictures of the moon? The app will calculate the location of the moon
        at that time.
    </string>

    <string name="moon_test_calibration">
        If you don\'t have any extra equipment like a tripod or external lens, you can now enter Capture Mode and the
        app will take pictures of the moon at the time you selected.
        \n\nIf you have an external lens, the app can help you focus it correctly. If you are attaching your phone to
        a tripod, the app can help you point the phone in the right direction.
    </string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_direction">
        Turn your phone in the direction of the red line. As you get closer to the correct direction,
        the blue circle will get larger. The circle will turn green when your phone and tripod
        are correctly calibrated.
    </string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_lens">
        Point the camera at an object that is more than 100 ft away, like a tree or a building (or
        the moon itself!). Adjust the focus of the external lens until the object in the preview
        appears crisp and in focus. You may adjust the brightness of the preview using the buttons
        above.
    </string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_compass_instructions">
        Align the phone so the moon appears in the center of the red crosshairs. Then press NEXT.
    </string>
    <string name="moon_test_point_phone_instructions">
        Use the alignment guide below to point the phone towards the predicted location of the moon.
        Then press FINISH.
