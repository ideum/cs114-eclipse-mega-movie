    <string name="intro_text_0">On August 21st, 2017, a total solar eclipse will traverse North America.
        This app allows you to capture images of the event and participate in an unprecedented citizen-science project.</string>
    <string name="intro_text_1">Everybody! The app does all the hard work of controlling your smarphone
        camera and capturing images of the eclipse at just the right times. It can be used by itself,
        or together with an external lens and tripod.</string>
    <string name="intro_text_2">The app is incredibly easy to use: you just point it in the right direction during the eclipse and it does the rest! If you have additional equipment, the app will guide you to set everything up correctly to get the best posible results.</string>

    <string name="about_megamovie">About Megamovie Mobile\n\nThe Megamovie Mobile app allows you to capture images of the solar eclipse on August 21, 2017.
        It also enables you to share your photos with scientists for a citizen science project led by UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory and Google.
        Click [here] to learn more about the Megamovie Project.\n\n The app can capture valuable scientific information without additional equipment.
        But you can obtain even better results by using an external lens and tripod with your phone. If you already have this equipment or want to learn more,
        use our built-in [Assistant] to customize the app.\n\n If you are using an external lens and tripod, the app has a calibration mode that will
        help you focus the lens and point the camera in the right direction. You can practice with these features by capturing images of the moon.\n\n
        One outcome of the Megamovie Project will be a movie of the eclipse as it moves across the US. The movie will incorporate high-quality images
        captured by trained volunteers with DSLR cameras. Once it is available, you can download and view it in the [Eclipse Megamovie] section.\n\n\n\n\n

    <string name="assistant_only_phone">The Megamovie Mobile app is designed to help you use your camera phone to take the best possible images of the solar eclipse.
        It tells you when and where to see the eclipse, how to aim your camera when the eclipse is about to start, and automatically controls your camera’s settings
        and shutter to take a series of photos during the event. All you’ll have to do is be ready and follow a few simple instructions when the time comes.\n\nThe
        app also gives you a way to practice before the eclipse so you’ll feel comfortable when the big day arrives—by taking pictures of the moon. Go to Moon test to try it out.
    </string>
    <string name="assistant_equipment">Holding a camera by hand can cause tiny vibrations that blur photos.
        This can be especially troublesome with astronomical images. Mounting your phone on a tripod is an easy way to improve your photos.
        There are many kinds of tripods available for cell phones, including inexpensive ones made by Joby, Square Jellyfish, and Charger City.
        \n\nAlso, while your phone may have a great camera, images of the sun are likely to be small unless you use an external lens like those made by Olloclip, Moment, Mozeat, and instaLens. Lenses like these are easy to attach to your phone and can help you take great photos of many things in addition to the eclipse.
        \n\nGo to Calibrate your camera to set up your phone with a tripod and lens.

    <string name="assistant_dslr">
        If you want to use a separate camera to photograph the eclipse, you can still use the eclipse map and countdown functions in the Megamovie Mobile app.
        You can view those features here. Goes to Eclipse 2017: Where and When?
        \n\nYou may also be interested in being an official volunteer to capture images for the Megamovie itself. To learn more, visit the Google Megamovie Website.
