    <string name="safety_warning">"Even a short glance at the sun can cause permanent eye damage. That’s also true during the first and last phases of an eclipse when the sun’s disk is partially covered. So while the dimmer light of a partial eclipse may tempt you, the only time you can safely view the sun is the short period called totality, when the sun is completely covered by the moon.

    <string name="intro_text">On July 2, 2019, a total solar eclipse will be visible in South America. People in the narrow path of totality will see the sun\'s disk completely covered by the moon. This app makes it easy to be part of an exciting citizen-science project and capture great images of this amazing event.</string>
    <string name="intro_text_1">Everyone! This app does all the hard work of controlling your smartphone         camera to capture images of the eclipse at just the right times. You can use it with just your phone     or with an external lens and tripod to get even sharper images of this once-in-a-lifetime event.</string>
    <string name="intro_text_2">The app is very easy to use. You just have to point your phone in the right direction during the eclipse     and the app takes the pictures for you. If you have an external lens and tripod, the app will help you set everything up     to get the best shots possible.</string>

    <string name="about_megamovie">"The Eclipse Camera 2019 app was created by Ideum, Inc. and UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory.   This app allows you to capture images of the solar eclipse on July 2, 2019. The app can capture valuable scientific information without additional equipment. But you can obtain even better results with an external lens and tripod. If you already have this equipment or want to learn more, use our built-in Eclipse Orientation to customize the app.   If you are using an external lens and tripod, the app has a Calibration mode that will help you focus the lens and point the camera in the right direction. You can practice by capturing images of the moon. "</string>
    <string name="orientation_intro">"         The Orientation mode helps you determine how best to use the app.           Answer a few questions on the next screen to optimize your eclipse experience.     "</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_phone">"         The Megamovie Mobile app is designed to help you use your camera phone to take the best possible images of the solar eclipse.         It tells you when and where to see the eclipse, how to aim your camera when the eclipse is about to start, and automatically controls your camera’s settings         and shutter to take a series of photos during the event. All you’ll have to do is be ready and follow a few simple instructions when the time comes.  The         app also gives you a way to practice before the eclipse so you’ll feel comfortable when the big day arrives—by taking pictures of the moon or sun. Go to practice mode to try it out.     "</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_equipment">"         Holding a camera by hand can cause tiny vibrations that blur photos.         This can be especially troublesome with astronomical images. Mounting your phone on a tripod is an easy way to improve your photos.         There are many kinds of tripods available for cell phones, including inexpensive ones made by Joby, Square Jellyfish, and Charger City.         Also, while your phone may have a great camera, images of the sun are likely to be small unless you use an external lens like those         made by Apexel, Hsini, and Neewer. We recommend using a lens with a magnification of at least 20x, although the app is         compatible with any lens. Lenses like these are very portable and can help you take great photos of many things in addition to the eclipse.           Once you’ve decided on the equipment you’ll use, go to My Eclipse to enter your choice (you can change it at any time).           If you’re using an especially high-powered lens, you might consider using a tracking-mount. A relatively compact and inexpensive choice         is the Star Adventurer made by Sky-Watcher.      "</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_dslr">"         If you want to use a separate camera to photograph the eclipse, you can still use the eclipse map and countdown functions in the Megamovie Mobile app.            You may also be interested in being an official volunteer to capture images for the Megamovie itself. To learn more, visit the <a href="https://eclipsemega.movie/">Megamovie Website</a>.     "</string>
    <string name="first_contact_dialog_message">"This is when the edge of the moon first         begins to cover the sun. Even though the sun will start to get dimmer at this point,         it’s still not safe to look directly at the eclipse. "</string>
    <string name="second_contact_dialog_message">"In a total solar eclipse, this is when         totality begins and the sun’s disk is completely covered by the moon. It is safe to remove         your eclipse glasses when you can no longer see the bright         sun through them. You can now see the sun’s hot, hazy outer atmosphere: the corona!  "</string>
    <string name="mid_eclipse_dialog_message">"         The sun’s corona, a halo of ionized gases, extends millions of miles into space.         At over 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, it is much hotter than the sun’s surface. You can only see the whole corona during a total eclipse,         such as this one.     "</string>
    <string name="third_contact_dialog_message">"Third contact is the moment when totality         ends and the sun begins to emerge from the moon’s shadow. As soon as the bright sun appears, you must put your eclipse glasses back on. "</string>
    <string name="fourth_contact_dialog_message">"This is the end of the eclipse. "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_intro">"         By using the app to capture images of the moon or sun, you'll become familiar with how the         app works and be ready to use it to photograph the main event: the solar eclipse.           This will be especially helpful if you will be using an external lens and tripod during the eclipse. You         can find tutorial videos explaining how to use the equipment <a>here.</a>     "</string>
    <string name="remove_case">Do you use a phone case? Calibration accuracy may be improved if you remove it.</string>
    <string name="practice_mode_ftp_request">To help the developers of this app, you can upload practice images         to ftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/megamovie/incoming</string>
    <string name="practice_mode_target_selection_prompt">"         Would you like to practice by taking pictures of the moon or sun? The conditions for these tests are quite different, so we recommend          practicing with both.     "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_select_time">"         When would you like to start taking pictures of the moon or sun? We recommend choosing a time at least 20 minutes in the future. Note that the app will start taking pictures         3 minutes before your chosen time, and continue for 3 minutes afterwards.     "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibration">"         If you don't have any extra equipment like a tripod or external lens, you can now enter Capture Mode.           If you have an external lens, the app can help you focus it correctly. If you are attaching your phone to         a tripod, the app can help you point the phone in the right direction.     "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_lens_explanation">"         If you are using an external lens, the app can help you focus it correctly.     "</string>

    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_direction">"         Turn your phone in the direction of the red line. As you get closer to the correct direction,         the blue circle will get larger. The circle will turn green when your phone and tripod         are correctly calibrated. Then press Capture Mode.     "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_lens">"         Point the camera at an object that is more than 100 feet away, like a tree or a building.         Adjust the focus of the external lens until the object in the preview         appears crisp and in focus. You may adjust the brightness of the preview using the buttons         above.     "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_calibrate_compass_instructions">"         Align the phone so the target appears in the center of the red crosshairs. Then press SET.     "</string>
    <string name="moon_test_point_phone_instructions">"         Use the alignment guide to point the phone towards the predicted location of the moon/sun.         Then enter Capture Mode.     "</string>
    <string name="compass_calibration_intro">"         The app will use your phone's compass to help point your camera in the right direction. To help         calibrate the compass, move your phone in a series of quick figure-eight movements until the compass         accuracy is high.     "</string>
    <string name="sun_test_warning">"         Remember not to look directly at the sun during the test.         Photographing the sun requires a solar filter or eclipse glasses to cover the lens. If it is         a hot day, be careful not to leave your phone outside for too long.     "</string>
    <string name="eclipse_day_intro_fragment_title">Eclipse Image Capture</string>
    <string name="eclipse_day_intro">The app can help you capture photos of the eclipse, and share them to the Megamovie Archive for scientific study.           The app will capture about 1GB worth of images, so make sure you have enough storage available on your phone.  Once you have entered Capture Mode,     the app will give an audio alert 15 seconds before the start of totality reminding you to remove your solar filter.</string>
    <string name="check_for_updates">Please check you have the most recent version of the app the day before the eclipse!</string>
    <string name="eclipse_day_instructions">"         The app will take pictures only during totality, when the sun is completely covered by the moon. During totality, you just not cover the         lens with a solar filter. However, before totality you will need a filter to protect your phone. The app will remind you with an audio         cue to remove the filter 15 seconds before the start of totality.     "</string>
    <string name="equipment_intro">The app can help you set up your equipment. If you don\'t need help with this, you can go         directly to Capture Mode.           Remember to use a solar filter when pointing your lens. The app will remind you to remove it 15 seconds before the start of totality.</string>
